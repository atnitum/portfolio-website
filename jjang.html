          <p><strong>What</strong> is it? An e-commerce app with a large library of music, merchandise and cosmetics related to the K-Pop scene</p>
          <p><strong>Who</strong> is it for? Fans of K-Pop artists who are interested in buying goods related to their favourite idols</p>
          <p><strong>Where</strong> is it used? This product can be used pretty much anywhere, whilst a user is commuting, on a lunch break, or simply at home</p>
          <p><strong>Why</strong> is it necessary? It can be hard for some fans to find specific products as they are not based in South Korea. They may also find that they need to order from several different sites in order to obtain the products
            they need</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>As this project was completed for my Career Foundry Course, I designed the entirety of the project from scratch, working through the entire UI process. From determining the brand guidelines, creating icons, and visually designing the
            final screens.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>My Process</h2>

            <source srcset="img/jjang/brandguidelines@1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/jjang/brandguidelines@2x.jpg" alt="Jjang Brand Guidelines">
          </picture>
          <p>I began this project by fleshing out a full brand guideline, something I had yet to do on previous tasks. This proved very helpful, as it meant I could keep my focus when it came to implementing design ideas and guides further on in the
            UI ideation.</p><br>
          <p>Next, I defined my three key user stories to pinpoint specifically how exactly my design would solve user problems.

          <h2>Wireframing</h2>
          <p>Low-fidelity wireframes sketched out in Procreate helped to establish the skeleton of the user flows I had chosen, however through several rounds of mid-fidelity wireframing,
            I established how and why certain aspects of my screens were unnecessary and a hindrance to users. While the process took quite a bit of time,
            it helped me clean up my flows and prepare them for further development and usability testing.</p>

          <p>The majority of icons, typography and copy were further refined in my high-fidelity wireframes.</p><br>

          <h2>User Testing</h2>
          <p>After completing the design of all my screens, I moved onto user testing to see how users would navigate my application after being given the senario detailed below.
            A prototype for this user story can be accessed <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/56d6c32a-b57c-4bf4-a1c8-dae77d6bd70d-0385/">HERE.</a></p>

          </picture>
          <p>User testing exposed me to faults such as padding issues, unnecessary wording and confusing icons. I refined these issues to then create my finalised screens and responsive breakpoints.</p>
          <p>Below are some of the changes I made to my screens after feedback.</p><br>

          <p>This project gave me the opportunity to think about consumers with a little more empathy. Whilst I have experience working in retail and shipping online orders, I found I needed to dig deep into the mind of the typical consumer
            considering the unique aspects of my app.
            What may work for one user may be incredibly irritating to another, and so finding a middle ground that would be a viable solution to both problems was a challenging yet rewarding aspect of this project.</p>
